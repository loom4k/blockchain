# BlockChain API

I built this little side project to learn more about Blockchain and Tokens. It might be maintained and implemented to other projects but it is not guaranteed to be completed. ***Bugs might appear***

## Installation

1. Make sure [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe) is installed on your machine.
2. Install [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv)

```
$ pip install pipenv
```
3. Install all requirements

```
$ pip install
```

4. Run the server

   - `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py`
   - `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py -p 5001`
   - `$ pipenv run python blockchain.py --port 5002`
